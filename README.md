<h4>Project title: Adventures of Professor S.</h4>
 
<h4>Project Description</h4>
Website housing an original interactive comic. Our comic revolves around our protagonist, Professor S. who is sent across different universes by the viewers. The different worlds Professor S. ends up in are drawn in the art styles of famous existing comics/manga.  My  group and I were inspired by the movie Spiderman: into the Spiderverse. We wanted to showcase distinct art styles to emulate the different universes, similar to how spiderman's counterparts from different universes are animated in different art styles in the movie.
 
<h4>Process</h4>
We began our discussion by first listing out comic art styles we wanted to reproduce, and narrowed it down to 'Charlie Brown', 'Naruto', 'Archie' and 'Pusheen cat'. Each of these styles will have a panel dedicated to them that Professor S. will travel through where she will make friends along the way. We thought it would be funny if Professor S. drops into our universe and breaks the fourth wall by speaking directly to the user, so we used photos from class in panel 6 to do this.
Next, we began building the website according to our wireframe, with varying adjustments along the way. We did not want to limit our theme of diverse art styles to the comic panels alone, so we decided to also create the website with a distinct design in mind. This is how we ended up with a retro arcade game design for the website and pixelated buttons to traverse through panels (and drop Professor S. into different universes).

<h4>My contributions</h4>
* Created panel 6 (breaking fourth wall panel) in photoshop.
* Organised panels 1 to 7 into seperate divs in html file and imbeded the comic panels
* Created the portal transition by building functions in javascript

<h4>Evaluation</h4>
I am happy with the final website and enjoyed creating it. I believe it conveys a cohesive story well, with high-quality art and fun interactions. I also wanted to incorporate unique sound effects for each individual panel, but I was not able to get the code to work consistently in time, so I decided to avoid it all together. I hope to employ sounds effects and other sensory stimuli in future projects for a more immersive experience.
